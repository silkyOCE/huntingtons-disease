                <b>Cures:</b> Currently, there are no known cures for Huntington's disease. However, there is currently research happening to help create a cure.
                <br>Scientists are researching a way to reduce the amount of the mutant huntingtin gene. A new type of gene therapy called <b>CRISPR</b> to remove the defective parts of the gene and replace it with the healthy version of the gene.
                <br>There is also research going into what causes the nerve cells to be susceptible to genes like huntingtin.
                <img src="Images/StemCell.jpg" height="195.733333334" width="293.3336"class="stemCell">
                This would help to learn about how to fight the gene or protect the body from the gene, which could extend the lifespan of one diagnosed with the disease.
                <br>There is also research to help replace the lost cells, called <b>stem cell therapy</b>, allowing the disease to slowly get rid of the current nerve cells, as they would be replaced by the new cells in production.
                They are considering the use of stem cells from embryos, that will end up becoming specialised cells in the body, thus replacing the current mutant genes.
                <br><b>Treatments:</b> Currently, there are no treatments to stop the mortality of the disease. Certain medications can assist with lessening the symptoms that the disease has.
                Certain drugs have been used to control the random movements that comes with the disease. These include tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine.
                Unfortunately, the drugs could cause the patient to feel drowsy, restless or causing mental issues such as depression and anxiety.

                <br><b>Antipsychotic drugs</b> are being used to help suppress moves, even though they could worsen the patient's involuntary contractions, restlessness and drowsiness.
                These drugs include haloperidol and fluphenazine. There are other drugs such as risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine, although they could worsen current symptoms.
                <br>There are also treatments for psychiatric disorders that occur with the disease.
                <br><b>Antidepressants</b> such as citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine and sertraline help deal with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder that the patients go through.
                However there are potential side effects including nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness and low blood pressure.
                <br><b>Other antipsychotic drugs</b> such as such as quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine can help with mood swings and outbursts that occur. A problem with this is that they could cause movement disorders for the patient.
                <br><b>Drugs</b> that help with the bipolar disease that can come with Huntington's disease include divalproex, carbamazepine and lamotrigine. These drugs will help with the mood swings that occur, including the highs and lows that happen.
                <br><b>Therapy</b> is also available for different purposes, including speech therapy, physical therapy, psychotherapy and occupational therapy.
