                Huntington's disease is usually inherited through the parents genes. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that only one copy of the genes needs to be inherited in order to get the disease.
                There is a slight potential that there are other ways to inherit the disorder, but it is relatively uncommon. The child has a 50% chance of receiving the gene from their parents as their parents could pass the defective gene down, or the healthy gene.
                However, there is approximately a 10% chance to develop Huntington's disease without previous family history. In this case, it is assumed that their parents or grandparents were wrongly diagnosed with another disease.
                There is also a chance that their parents died before they could be diagnosed with the disease or display symptoms of the disease. It could also be from a new mutation of Huntington's disease.
