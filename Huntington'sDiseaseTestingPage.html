                Currently, testing is available to diagnose a patient with the condition. Multiple methods can be used.<br><b>Neurological and Physical testing:</b> One method is to look into a patient's medical history to remove certain possibilities of other conditions.
                <img src="Images/HuntingtonsResults.png" class="huntingtonsResults">
                They will also conduct a neurological and physical exam on the patient to determine if they exert symptoms of the disease such as one's balance, movement and more.
                <br><b>Genetic testing:</b> Another method of diagnosis is to conduct a genetic test. The best version of the test, based on accuracy and effectiveness, is known as the direct genetic test.
                The patient is required to give a sample of blood, from which the doctors will analyse to determine the number of times that CAG is repeated in the DNA.
                <img src="Images/BrainScan.jpg" height"293.6" width="440" class="brainScan">
                The results being higher than 36 supports the presence of Huntington's disease. However, if the results are below 26, it rules out the possiblity of Huntington's disease.
                <br><b>Brain Imaging:</b> At certain times, a brain scan me be recommended by the doctor. This is mainly done when both tests prove to be inconclusive.
                The scan reveals parts of the brain that have shrunk and the enlargement of cavities filled with fluids inside the brain.
                <br><b>Laws around testing:</b>Testing for the disease became available around 1993 to determine if the person had the gene for Huntington's disease.
                Currently, there is a law prohibiting those under 18 from testing for the disease. However, if one is older than 18 and has had a relative test positive for the disease, they may be allowed to receive testing.</p>
