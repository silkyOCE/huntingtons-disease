        <h1>About the Creator</h1>
        <p>My name is Haoyang Li and I created this website. It's purpose is to help educate people about Huntington's disease and allow them to understand the struggles and effects that people with the disease go through. I created this webpage with the help of different tutorials but made the majority from scratch. I hope you enjoy!
